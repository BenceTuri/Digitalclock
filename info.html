    <h1>Clock by Bence Turi</h1>
    <p>
      This is a project that I made when I was sick, so I had a little free
      time. <br />
      In the future I plan to post this onto Google Play one day. <br />
      The original idea came from The flip clock screensaver out there.
      <br />
      The project is open source on
      <a href="https://github.com/BenceTuri/Digitalclock">Github.</a>
